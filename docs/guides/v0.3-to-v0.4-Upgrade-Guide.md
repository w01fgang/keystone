# KeystoneJS v0.3.x to v0.4.0 Upgrade Guide

## Changes to express application and mounting

**WIP**

The mounting process has been rewritten for modularity and clarity. This may introduce some breaking changes if your app has been attaching the Keystone Admin UI to a nonstandard express app (i.e. not using `Keystone.start()`, but should make things simpler going forward.

### Changed

* `keystone.get('express session')` has been replaced by `keystone.expressSession`
* Session initialisation middleware is now executed before the body parser to allow for the Admin UI to include its own bodyParser implementation
* IP Restrictions middleware is now processed first, which means that static assets will now respect restrictions (previously this only restricted routes)
* `keystone.routes(fn)` has been replaced by `keystone.set('routes', fn)`
* the `routes` option supports both:
  * the legacy `function (app) {}` way of adding routes to the root express app
  * an `express.Router` instance

### Removed

* `keystone.static` has been removed (replacement TBA, see `admin/server`)
* `keystone.mount` has been removed (replaced by more granular methods, see `admin/server`)
* `keystone.bindEmailTestRoutes` and `keystone.set('email tests')` support (was this actually being used by anyone? let me know - @jedwatson)
* `keystone.set('email rules')` option has been removed; you should just use variables in your templates, rather than globally applied regular expressions.

## File handling Field Types

### New `File` field type

The new `File` field type, with the `FS`, `S3` and `Azure` storage adapters, replace the following field types (which are removed in 0.4) -

- `azureFile`
- `localFile`
- `localFiles`
- `s3File`

For usage instructions, see:
- [The Storage API](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/master/lib/storage)
- [Local FileSystem Adapter](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/master/lib/storage/adapters/fs)
- [Azure Storage Adapter](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-storage-adapter-azure)
- [S3 Storage Adapter](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-storage-adapter-s3)

### CloudinaryImage

The `_upload` suffix is no longer required or supported when uploading files from an html form. Now simply provide the cloudinary field path as the name of file upload fields. For example:

```html
<!-- old -->
<input type="file" name="picture_upload" />
<!-- new -->
<input type="file" name="picture" />
```

### CloudinaryImages

When the `cloudinary folders` keystone option is set, in 0.3.x `CloudinaryImages` fields would incorrectly use the `cloudinary prefix` option's value as the first part of the folder path for fields that did not specify the `folder` option. This has been fixed; the folder for uploaded images now defaults to `this.list.path + '/' + this.path`

## Field API Changes

* **updateItem** is now asynchronous and need to pass a callback:
  * Before: `field.updateItem(item, data)`
  * After: `field.updateItem(item, data, function(err) {...})`

## Mongoose 4

The bundled version of Mongoose has been updated from 3.x to 4.x. Please review the [Migration Guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/migration.html) and [Release Notes](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/wiki/4.0-Release-Notes) for more information.
